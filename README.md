# Triglyceride_Localization_via_Edge-Triggered_Segmentation_system_windows
An automated image analysis system for quantifying triglyceride content in cell culture images using computer vision and edge-triggered segmentation. The system processes microscopic images, detects lipid droplets (triglycerides), performs statistical analysis, and generates comprehensive reports.
